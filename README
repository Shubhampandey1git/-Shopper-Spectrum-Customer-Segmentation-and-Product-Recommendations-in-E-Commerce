# 🛒 Shopper Spectrum:
**Customer Segmentation and Product Recommendations in E-Commerce**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**Shopper Spectrum** is a full-stack machine learning project that analyzes customer purchase behavior to:

- Segment customers using **RFM analysis** and **KMeans clustering**
- Recommend similar products using **item-based collaborative filtering** and **cosine similarity**
- Deliver a clean and interactive user experience via a **Streamlit web app**

---

## ✨ Features

✅ RFM-based Customer Segmentation  
✅ KMeans Clustering with dynamic cluster labeling  
✅ Cosine Similarity–based Product Recommendations  
✅ Dual Modules in Streamlit (Recommendation + Segmentation)  
✅ Clean, interactive UI for real-time use

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- **RFM Analysis**: Calculates Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value for each customer  
- **Clustering**: Applies KMeans to group customers into 5 segments (e.g., High-Value, At-Risk)  
- **Recommendation Engine**: Uses item-based collaborative filtering to suggest 5 similar products  
- **Streamlit App**: Provides an easy-to-use interface to explore segments and get product suggestions
